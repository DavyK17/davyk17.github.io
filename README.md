# Portfolio website

This was initially a challenge project I did as part of my full stack engineer course on [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com), providing a list of projects I've done as a web developer.

I first built the website using React, but then decided to rebuild it using SvelteKit, as I wanted to familiarise myself with Svelte 5. The React version has been archived in the `react` branch.

Enjoy checking out the (mostly basic) stuff I've built!
